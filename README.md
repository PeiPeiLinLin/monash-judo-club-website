# monash-judo-club-website
A clean, open-source website for a local Judo club. Built for community access, free of ads, and designed for long-term maintainability.

This website is currently build by HTML + CSS + JavaScript, and we have plans to transfer it to React, once our Contributors learn how those things work

The website is down below:
